# Linked List Playground in C++: Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked List Implementations

An interactive C++17 program that demonstrates multiple types of linked lists:

- **Singly Linked List** (with `unique_ptr`)
- **Doubly Linked List** (manual memory management)
- **Circular Linked List** (manual memory management)
- **STL `forward_list`** (singly linked list)
- **STL `list`** (doubly linked list)

This program is a complete learning tool for beginners and intermediate programmers who want to:
- Understand the differences between linked list types
- Practice inserting, deleting, and traversing nodes
- See modern C++ features applied to classic data structures
